# Welcome to the Knowledge Base

This is a sample markdown file to test the voice assistant functionality.

## About This System

This voice assistant can answer questions based on the markdown files stored in this directory. It uses:

- Voice-to-text transcription
- Semantic search with vector embeddings
- AI-powered question answering
- Text-to-speech response generation

## How It Works

1. You speak a question
2. The system transcribes your voice to text
3. It searches through all markdown files using semantic similarity
4. An AI agent generates a contextual answer based on the found content
5. The answer is spoken back to you

## Example Questions

Try asking:

- "What is this knowledge base system?"
- "How does the voice assistant work?"
- "What technology does this use?"

Feel free to add more markdown files to expand the knowledge base!
